                            We carefully analyze what types of
                            information we need to provide our
                            services, and we try to limit the
                            information we collect to only
                            what we really need. Where
                            possible, we delete or anonymize
                            this information when we no longer
                            need it. When building and
                            improving our products, our
                            engineers work closely with our
                            privacy and security teams to
                            build with privacy in mind. In all
                            of this work our guiding principle
                            is that your information belongs
                            to you, and we aim to only use
                            your information to your benefit.
